# Urban AI Explorer - Conversational Programming Platform

context driven AI-native development platform where natural language becomes the programming interface for specific domains.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `explorer/src/main/resources/application.properties.template` to `application.properties`
3. Add your Anthropic API key to `application.properties`
4. Start backend: `cd explorer && mvn spring-boot:run`
5. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm start`

## Features

- Natural language programming interface
- Real-time AI intent classification
- Conversational behavior generation
- Matrix-style futuristic UI
- Learning pattern tracking

## Phase 2: Advanced Conversational Programming

- Context-aware conversations that remember previous interactions
- Complex multi-step planning (like actual itinerary generation)
- Dynamic behavior modification based on user feedback

## Phase 3: Platform Abstraction

- Extract this pattern into a reusable framework
- Make it work for any domain (not just travel)
- Open-source the conversational programming architecture
